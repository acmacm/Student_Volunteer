# Student_Volunteer
Supporting a proposal to acknowledge Student Volunteers in OPNFV, this is the proposed text of the Letter such students could use as part of their references.

LFâ€™s Paid Interns already receive a letter of reference/completion 
(so we need to distinguish the Student Volunteer clearly
in the text of the new letter, this is why I chose the name
for this category very carefully).
