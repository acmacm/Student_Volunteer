# Student_Volunteer
Supporting a proposal to acknowledge Student Volunteers in OPNFV, this is the high-level process and proposed text of the Letter such students could use as part of their references.

The process of selecting Student Volunteers follows a similar process to select Paid Interns. The OPNFV PTL will define the project and the success criteria along with dates, recruit and select Student Volunteers, mentor the Student through the project period, and inform the TSC of the completion of these milestones.

LFâ€™s Paid Interns already receive a letter of reference/completion 
(so we need to distinguish the Student Volunteer clearly
in the text of the new letter, this is why I chose the name
for this category very carefully).
